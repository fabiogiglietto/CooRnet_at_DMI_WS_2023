# **Detecting Coordinated Link Sharing Behaviour with CooRnet**

Code and data repository for the "Detecting Coordinated Link Sharing Behaviour with [CooRnet](https://coornet.org/)" tutorial at the [Digital Media Initiative 2023 Winter School](https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/WinterSchool2023).

## Abstract

In this tutorial, we use CooRnet - a tool developed in R for detecting coordinated link-sharing behaviour (CLSB) - to map networks of problematic social media actors that shared posts on the Ukraine War. Coordinated link sharing is a type of online manipulation in which a group of individuals or organizations work together to amplify the visibility of certain content on social media platforms. CooRnet allows users to analyze the link-sharing patterns and detect groups of accounts that exhibit coordinated behaviour. The tutorial will cover the basics of using CooRnet, including how to install and load the package, where to find and how to prepare input data, and how to interpret and visualize the output. By the end of this tutorial, users will have a solid understanding of how to use CooRnet to detect coordinated link-sharing behaviour on Facebook.

The tutorial will cover the following topics:

-   Online Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour, what it is and why it is a problem.

-   Leveraging CrowdTangle data to detect CLSB on Facebook.

-   CooRnet functions, implementation of CLSB concepts.

-   Analysis and interpretation of CooRnet's output.

-   Open problems and current challenges of CIB.
